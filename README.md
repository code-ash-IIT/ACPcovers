# ACPcovers


The "Automated Cricket Pitch Covers" that our team is developing have a variety of features, including being managed by an app that instructs an Arduino to roll and unroll a rod through the motor as well as control motor functionality for moving tires backward and forward. When it rains, eight to ten employees drag a heavy sheet to the ground, consuming a lot of labor and materials. Our project will lower the cost of the additional labor required for this job.
